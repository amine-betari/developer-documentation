# MatchAll Criterion

The [`MatchAll` Search Criterion](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-kernel/blob/v1.0.0/eZ/Publish/API/Repository/Values/Content/Query/Criterion/MatchAll.php)
is an auxiliary Criterion that returns all search results.
It is used internally when no filter or query is provided on a Query object.

The Criterion takes no arguments.
